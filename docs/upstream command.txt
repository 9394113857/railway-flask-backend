Push the branch with --set-upstream flag:
git push --set-upstream origin feature/sqlalchemy-migrations

1. This will push your local feature/sqlalchemy-migrations branch to the remote origin 
and set up the upstream relationship.

2. The commit message "Pushing new branch to remote origin" should make it clear 
that you're pushing a new branch for the first time.
